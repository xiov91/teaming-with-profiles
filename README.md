# Teaming With Profiles
 
  ## Description
  Teaming With Profiles is a CLI program that takes the information you input and, using Inquirer, populates a page with a profile of a team. Or at least, it would be if I had the time to finish it. Unfortunately, at this moment, I'm so far behind with the rest of the bootcamp, I can't devote the time I'd like to really get the functionality going. There's not even much of anything to take a video of.

  [You can view what little video I have here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GiPviGgwIWKxAR70uTvBaJCOHO98sd1z/view)
